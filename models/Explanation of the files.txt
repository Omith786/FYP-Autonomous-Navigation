For DQN and A2C , the file name are a bit different ("until_stage") , and that's
because those were the first two models I trained and at the time the script was
programmed to save it as that. So those files were trained with the default parameters. 
But once I realised that once I'd have to train multiple models it would get difficult 
to track the different models so I changed the naming style to have the timestamps in them. 
I did this from the PPO onwards.

For all the files the stage 4 is the final fully trained model.

For DQN and A2C , the stage 4 Optuna is their best model, while for PPO it is the pruned file,
which works the same as optuna stage 4 but the file size is lighter.

I've only put the models that are the default and the models that are with optuna, adding everything
such as from all the test runs from manual tuning and other coding changes, would have made this folder way too cluttered.

I've also put all the stage 4 files in the new folder.
